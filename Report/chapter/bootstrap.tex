\chapter{Bootstrap}
\label{chp:boots}

The bootstrap is an extremely powerful statistical tool that can be used to quantify the uncertainty associated with a given estimator or statistical learning method.

It can be used to estimate the standard errors of the coefficients from a linear regression fit. This is just a simple example. However, the power of the bootstrap lies in the fact that it easily can be applied to a wide range of statistical learnings methods.

Bootstrap relies on random sampling with replacement. Replacement means that the same observations can occur more than once in the bootstrap data set.
