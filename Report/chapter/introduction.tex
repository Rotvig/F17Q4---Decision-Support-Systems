\label{chp:intro}

This report is a part of the mandatory work in the course Decision Support Systems at Aarhus University Department of Engineering.
In the report, a series of lab exercises will be presented along with the corresponding theory from the book \emph{An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R}\cite{ISLR}. 
The theory covers the curriculum of the course and the lab exercises show the understanding of the theory. 

Through the report, the theory will be presented right before the corresponding lab exercise as to give the necessary understanding before reading the lab. The lab exercises are written in Python 2.7 and are regularly carried out along the span of the course.
